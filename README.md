The application combines security principles at the authentication level provided by Firebase Authentication, the preservation of the user's identity by encripting the data, and at the payments level by using Stripe, the strongest infrastructure in online payments.

Caritas works on Android and offers the user the opportunity to choose the organization he wants to donate to. To create a more enjoyable user experience, the list of organizations, along with a brief description, a representative photo and an external link to the official website of the organization is generated by a recommendation system based on neural networks and machine learning (ML). Another inovation proposed in the current work is the use of artificial intelligence to create a strong relationship between the donor and the organizations.

The application aims to provide a safe and fast method of donation to the 67.5% of the world's population, owners of mobile devices. In Caritas, the time required for the authentication process by creating an account with a social network: Google or Facebook, making the choice of organization and the donation process is on average 25.2 seconds.

The technologies used for Caritas are presented in photo below.
